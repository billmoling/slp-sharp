About
------

slp-sharp is a simple wrapper around the client side service discovery parts 
of OpenSLP (http://openslp.org).

Using slp-sharp you can currently search for advertised services of a particular
service type and also supply scopes.

Eg:

using System;
using SlpSharp;

namespace slpsharptest
{
  class MainClass
  {
    public static void Main (string[] args)
    {
      using ( var slp = new SlpClient( String.Empty ) ){
        Console.WriteLine("SLP Opened");

        slp.Find( "inbtest:inb.http", new string[0],
          delegate ( string url, UInt16 lifetime ){
	    // found a service
            Console.WriteLine("found {0}, lifetime = {1}", url, lifetime );
          } );

      }
      Console.WriteLine("SLP Closed");

    }
  }
}
